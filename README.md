# SysBox

This repository is the spiritual successor to my previous [sysadmin-utils repository](https://github.com/skx/sysadmin-util)

The idea here is to collect simple utilities and package them as a single binary, written in go, in a similar fashion to the `busybox` utility.

## Installation

Installation upon a system which already contains a go-compiler should be as simple as:

```
$ go get github.com/skx/sysbox
```

If you prefer you can find binary releases upon our [download page](https://github.com/skx/sysbox/releases).


## Bash Completion

The [subcommand library](https://github.com/skx/subcommands) this application uses has integrated support for the generation of bash completion scripts.

To enable this add the following to your bash configuration-file:

```
source <(sysbox bash-completion)

```


# Overview

This application is built, and distributed, as a single-binary named`sysbox`, which implements a number of sub-commands.

You can either run the tools individually, taking advantage of the [bash completion](#bash-completion) support to complete the subcommands and their arguments:

    $ sysbox foo ..
    $ sysbox bar ..

Or you can create symlinks to allow specific tool to be executed without the need to specify a subcommand:

    $ ln -s sysbox foo
    $ foo ..

This process of creating symlinks can be automated via the use of the `sysbox install` sub-command, which would allow you to install the tools globally like so:

    $ go get github.com/skx/sysbox
    $ $GOPATH/bin/sysbox install -binary $GOPATH/bin/sysbox -directory /usr/local/bin | sudo sh



# Tools

The tools in this repository started out as being simple ports of the tools in my [previous repository](https://github.com/skx/sysadmin-util), however I've now started to expand them and fold in things I've used/created in the past.

You can view a summary of the available subcommands via:

    $ sysbox help

More complete help for each command should be available like so:

    $ sysbox help sub-command

Examples are included where useful.


## calc

A simple calculator, which understands floating point-operations, unlinke `expr`.

The calculator supports either execution of sums via via the command-line, or as an interactive REPL environment:

```
$ sysbox calc 3.1 + 2.7
5.800000

$ ./sysbox calc
calc> let a = 1/3
0.333333
calc> a * 9
3
calc> exit
$
```

## choose-file

This subcommand presents a console-based UI to select a file.  The file selected will be displayed upon STDOUT.  The list may be filtered via an input-field.

Useful for launching videos, emulators, etc:

* `sysbox choose-file -execute="xine -g --no-logo --no-splash -V=40 {}" ~/Videos`
  * Choose a file, and execute `xine` with that filename as one of the arguments.
* `xine $(sysbox choose-file ~/Videos)`
  * Use the STDOUT result to launch instead.

The first form is preferred, because if the selection is canceled nothing happens.  In the second-case `xine` would be launched with no argument.


## choose-stdin

Almost identical to `choose-file`, but instead of allowing the user to choose from a filename it allows choosing from the contents read on STDIN.  For example you might allow choosing a directory:

```
$ find ~/Repos -type d | sysbox choose-stdin -execute="firefox {}"
```


## chronic

The chronic command is ideally suited to wrap cronjobs, it runs the command you specify as a child process and hides the output produced __unless__ that process exits with a non-zero exit-code.


## collapse

This is a simple tool which will read STDIN, and output the content without any extra white-space:

* Leading/Trailing white-space will be removed from every line.
* Empty lines will be skipped entirely.


## cpp

Something _like_ the C preprocessor, but supporting only the ability to include files, and run commands via `#include` and `#execute` respectively:

    #include "file/goes/here"
    #execute ls -l | wc -l

See also `env-template` which allows more flexibility in running commands, and including files (or parts of files) via templates.


## env-template

Perform expansion, via environmental variables, on simple golang templates.

You can freely use the built-in golang template facilities, for example please see the sample template here [cmd_env_template.tmpl](cmd_env_template.tmpl), and the the examples included in the [text/template documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

> As an alternative you can consider the `envsubst` binary contained in your system's `gettext{-base}` package.

**NOTE**: This sub-command also allows file-inclusion, in three different ways:

* Including files literally.
* Including lines from a file which match a particular regular expression.
* Including the region from a file which is bounded by two regular expressions.

See `sysbox help env-template` for further details, and examples.  You'll also
see it is possible to execute arbitrary commands and read their output.  This facility was inspired by the [embedmd](https://github.com/campoy/embedmd) utility, and added in [#17](https://github.com/skx/sysbox/issues/17).

See also `cpp` for a less flexible alternative with regard to mere file inclusion and command-execution.


## exec-stdin

Read STDIN, and allow running a command for each line.  You can refer to
the line read either completely, or by fields.

For example:

```
$ ps -ef | sysbox exec-stdin echo field1:{1} field2:{2} line:{}
```

See the usage-information for more details (`sysbox help exec-stdin`), but consider this a simple union of `awk`, `xargs`, and GNU parallel (since we can run multiple commands in parallel).


## expect

expect allows you to spawn a process, and send input in response to given output read from that process.  It can be used to perform simple scripting operations against remote routers, etc.

For examples please consult the output of `sysbox help expect`, but a simple example would be the following, which uses telnet to connect to a remote host and run a couple of commands.  Note that we use `\r\n` explicitly, due to telnet being in use, and that there is no password-authentication required in this example:

```sh
    $ cat script.in
    SPAWN telnet telehack.com
    EXPECT \n\.
    SEND   date\r\n
    EXPECT \n\.
    SEND   quit\r\n

    $ sysbox expect script.in
```


## fingerd

A trivial finger-server.


## httpd

A simple HTTP-server.  Allows serving to localhost, or to the local LAN.


## http-get

Very much "curl-lite", allows you to fetch the contents of a remote URL.  SSL errors, etc, are handled, but only minimal options are supported.


## install

This command allows you to install symlinks to the sysbox-binary, for ease of use:

```
$ sysbox install -binary=$(pwd)/sysbox -directory=~/bin | sh
```


## ips

This tool lets you easily retrieve a list of local, or global, IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses present upon your local host.  This is a little simpler
than trying to parse `ip -4 addr list`, although that is also the
common approach.


## make-password

This tool generates a single random password each time it is executed, it is designed to be quick and simple to use, rather than endlessly configurable.


## peerd

This deamon provides the ability to maintain a local list of available cluster-members, via the JSON file located at `/var/tmp/peerd.json`.

See the usage-information for more (`sysbox help peerd`).


## run-directory

Run every executable in the given directory, optionally terminate if any command returns a non-zero exit-code.

> The exit-code handling is what inspired this addition; the Debian version of `run-parts` supports this, but the CentOS version does not.


## splay

This tool allows sleeping for a random amount of time.  This solves the problem when you have a hundred servers all running a task at the same time, triggered by `cron`, and you don't want to overwhelm a central resource that they each consume.


## ssl-expiry

A simple utility to report upon the number of hours, and days, until a given TLS certificate (or any intermediary in the chain) expires.

Ideal for https-servers, but also TLS-protected SMTP hosts, etc.


## timeout

Run a command, but kill it after the given number of seconds.  The command is executed with a PTY so you can run interactive things such as `top`, `mutt`, etc.


## torrent

Simple bittorrent client, which allows downloading a magnet-based torrent.  For example to download an Ubuntu ISO:

```
$ sysbox torrent magnet:?xt=urn:btih:ZOCMZQIPFFW7OLLMIC5HUB6BPCSDEOQU
```


## tree

Trivial command to display the contents of a filesystem, as a nested tree.  This is similar to the standard `tree` command, without the nesting and ASCII graphics.


## urls

Extract URLs from the named files, or STDIN.  URLs are parsed naively with a simple regular expression and only `http` and `https` schemes are recognized.


## validate-json

Validate `*.json` files from the current working-directory, or the named directory, recursively.


## validate-yaml

Validate `*.yaml`/`*.yml` files from the current working-directory, or the named directory, recursively.


## with-lock

Allow running a command with a lock-file to prevent parallel executions.

This is perfect if you fear your cron-jobs will start slowing down and overlapping executions will cause problems.



# Future Additions?

Unlike the previous repository I'm much happier to allow submissions of new utilities, or sub-commands, in this repository.


# Github Setup

This repository is configured to run tests upon every commit, and when
pull-requests are created/updated.  The testing is carried out via
[.github/run-tests.sh](.github/run-tests.sh) which is used by the
[github-action-tester](https://github.com/skx/github-action-tester) action.

Releases are automated in a similar fashion via [.github/build](.github/build),
and the [github-action-publish-binaries](https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries) action.
